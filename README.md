## Prerequisites
RAGEMP has to be installed directly under the root of your drive. The game directory has to be free of any spaces due to Windows directory naming limitations.

**Example:** 
- ❌ RAGEMP is installed in: 
```
C:\Program Files\RAGEMP\ (Spaces in parent directory)
D:\RAGE MP\ (Spaces in folder name)
```
- ✅ RAGEMP is installed in: 
```
C:\RAGEMP\
D:\Games\RAGEMP\
```
## Installation
- Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/monstyy/RAGEMP-Opt-Script/releases/latest/) page;
- Extract the downloaded archive in the root directory of your RAGEMP installation;
    - **If prompt**, add an exception in your antivirus for the archive and its extraction. 
- Run rage-setup.bat for the first time installation;
- **(Optional)** Press 5 in the script to create a shortcut on your Desktop and use it to launch RAGEMP from now on.

## Optimizations

- Reintroduced the ENB and ReShade back again in RAGEMP after their removal due to the introduction of EasyAntiCheat;
- Lowering the priority of EACLauncher during startup to elucidate the process of the game launching;
- Adding the ability to set the game priority to High despite EasyAntiCheat preventing the change of the game priority;
- Added a memory pool optimization override that's replaced upon game startup;
- Completely customizable script to suit the user's needs.
